# Contributing Guidelines

These examples support the NVIDIA LLM community and facilitate feedback. We
invite contributions.

Use the following guidelines to contribute to this project.


## Merge Requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Create a fork in GitLab, then clone it locally.
2. Make changes on a focused branch and push that branch to your fork.
3. Open a Merge Request (MR) from the fork branch into the selected upstream
   branch.
4. Before requesting review, run `./scripts/ci-local.sh`, the serial integration
   suite, the locked dependency audits, and the Compose functional smoke listed
   in `AGENTS.md`. Hosted CI is intentionally not configured during the
   repository transition, so contributors are responsible for including local
   validation results in the MR.


## Signing Your Work
We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.
To sign off on a commit, use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

`$ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."`
This will append the following to your commit message:

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
